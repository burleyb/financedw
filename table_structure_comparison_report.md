# Table Structure Comparison Report: Silver vs Gold_Big_Deal

## Executive Summary

After comparing the table structures between the `silver` and `gold_big_deal` layers, I found **12 significant differences** that need to be addressed to ensure structural consistency. The silver layer has been enhanced with additional columns and improved data sourcing from bronze tables, while the gold_big_deal layer appears to be based on the older `silver.deal.big_deal` table structure.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Missing Tables
- **Missing in gold_big_deal**: `dim_down_payment_status`
- **Missing in silver**: `dim_down_paymant_status` (note the typo in filename)

### 2. Dimension Table Differences

#### `dim_driver`
**Silver has additional columns:**
- `_source_table STRING` (vs `_source_file_name STRING` in gold)
- `age INT`
- `dob DATE`
- `finscore DOUBLE`
- `home_phone_number STRING`
- `marital_status STRING`

**Impact**: Silver provides much richer driver demographics and financial scoring data.

#### `dim_bank`
**Silver has simplified structure:**
- `bank_id INT`
- `bank_slug STRING`

**Gold_big_deal has extensive bank details:**
- `address STRING`
- `bank_description STRING`
- `bank_display_name STRING`
- `city STRING`
- `is_auto_structure BOOLEAN`
- `is_auto_structure_buyout BOOLEAN`
- `is_auto_structure_refi BOOLEAN`
- `logo_url STRING`
- `min_credit_score INT`
- `phone STRING`
- `signing_solution STRING`
- `state STRING`
- `zip STRING`

**Impact**: Gold_big_deal has much more comprehensive bank information.

#### `dim_vehicle`
**Silver has additional valuation data:**
- `jdp_retail_value DOUBLE`
- `jdp_trade_in_value DOUBLE`
- `jdp_valuation_date DATE`
- `kbb_retail_value DOUBLE`
- `kbb_trade_in_value DOUBLE`
- `kbb_valuation_date DATE`
- `mileage INT`
- `model_year INT`
- `odometer_status STRING`

**Gold_big_deal has:**
- `model_year STRING` (different data type)

**Impact**: Silver provides comprehensive vehicle valuation data from multiple sources.

#### `dim_lienholder`
**Silver has additional:**
- `lienholder_slug STRING`

#### `dim_processor`
**Silver has additional:**
- `processor_type STRING`

### 3. Fact Table Differences

#### `fact_deals`
**Silver has:**
- `_source_table STRING`
- `ally_fees_amount BIGINT`

**Gold_big_deal has:**
- `_source_file_name STRING`

**Impact**: Silver includes ally fees as a separate measure and uses table-based source tracking.

#### `fact_deal_netsuite`
**Major structural difference**: 

**Silver has simplified structure:**
- `total_costs BIGINT`
- `total_revenue BIGINT`

**Gold_big_deal has detailed NetSuite account mapping:**
- 25+ specific NetSuite account fields (e.g., `bank_buyout_fees_5520`, `commission_5302`, etc.)
- `repo BOOLEAN`

**Impact**: Gold_big_deal provides granular NetSuite account-level detail, while silver has aggregated totals.

### 4. Parse Errors
The following tables couldn't be automatically parsed (likely due to different SQL patterns):
- `dim_address`
- `dim_date` 
- `dim_time`

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix filename typo**: Rename `dim_down_paymant_status.sql` to `dim_down_payment_status.sql` in gold_big_deal

2. **Standardize metadata columns**: Decide whether to use `_source_table` or `_source_file_name` consistently

3. **Address missing columns in silver**:
   - Add comprehensive bank details to `dim_bank`
   - Add detailed NetSuite account fields to `fact_deal_netsuite`

4. **Address missing columns in gold_big_deal**:
   - Add driver demographics (`age`, `dob`, `finscore`, etc.) to `dim_driver`
   - Add vehicle valuation data to `dim_vehicle`
   - Add `ally_fees_amount` to `fact_deals`

### Strategic Decisions Needed

1. **Data Granularity**: Determine if NetSuite facts should be:
   - Aggregated (silver approach) for simplicity
   - Detailed (gold_big_deal approach) for granular analysis

2. **Source Strategy**: Decide whether to:
   - Keep silver reading from bronze (current approach)
   - Have gold read from silver (medallion architecture)
   - Maintain both approaches for different use cases

3. **Data Types**: Standardize data types (e.g., `model_year` as INT vs STRING)

## Tables with Matching Structures âœ…

The following tables have identical structures and are properly aligned:
- `dim_deal`
- `dim_deal_state`
- `dim_deal_type`
- `dim_employee`
- `dim_employee_pod`
- `dim_employee_titling_pod`
- `dim_employment`
- `dim_employment_status`
- `dim_geography`
- `dim_marital_status`
- `dim_odometer_status`
- `dim_option_type`
- `dim_pay_frequency`
- `dim_pod`
- `dim_source`
- `dim_title_registration_option`
- `dim_titling_pod`
- `dim_vsc_type`
- `fact_deal_commissions`
- `fact_deal_payoff`

## Next Steps

1. Review this report with the team to determine the desired target structure
2. Create migration scripts to align the structures
3. Update the silver layer to include missing columns from gold_big_deal
4. Update the gold layer to read from silver instead of big_deal
5. Implement comprehensive testing to ensure data integrity during the transition
