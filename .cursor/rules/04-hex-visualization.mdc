# Hex Visualization Layer

Hex provides the visual layer and BI query tool for the data warehouse.

## Connection

- Hex connects to Databricks via JDBC/ODBC
- Connection parameters are stored in Hex project settings
- Queries execute against the star schema tables in Databricks

## Components

- **Data Sources**: Connections to the Databricks warehouse
- **SQL Cells**: Direct SQL queries against the data warehouse
- **Python Cells**: Custom transformations and advanced analytics
- **Visualizations**: Charts, tables, and dashboards
- **Apps**: Interactive data applications for end users

## Development Workflow

1. Create SQL queries that access the star schema
2. Transform/prepare data using Python if needed
3. Design visualizations
4. Combine visuals into dashboards
5. Share dashboards with stakeholders

## Best Practices

- Use parameterized queries for interactive filtering
- Cache results when appropriate for performance
- Implement row-level security through Hex's security features
- Follow naming conventions for consistency
