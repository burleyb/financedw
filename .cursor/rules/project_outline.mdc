# Finance Data Warehouse Project Overview

## Project Goal
This project aims to create a star schema data warehouse from existing flat tables in Databricks to enable finance teams to perform ad-hoc reporting without developer intervention. The solution uses Hex as the visual layer and BI query tool for data analysis.

## Data Architecture
The project follows the medallion architecture in Databricks:

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingested from source systems (leaseend_db_public, bamboohr, etc.)
- **Silver Layer**: Cleaned and transformed data (e.g., silver.deal.big_deal)
- **Gold Layer**: Business-level aggregated data organized as a star schema with facts and dimensions

## Star Schema Design
The star schema will consist of:

- **Fact Tables**: Contain measurable, quantitative data (metrics)
  - Deal facts (sales, commissions, revenue)
  - Finance facts (payments, payoffs)
  - Customer interactions (calls, appointments)

- **Dimension Tables**: Provide context to the facts
  - Time dimension
  - Customer dimension
  - Vehicle dimension
  - Employee dimension
  - Geography dimension
  - Product dimension (VSC, GAP)

## Key Data Sources
The primary data sources as defined in [data_definitions.sql](mdc:data_definitions.sql) include:

1. **Lease End Application Data**
   - Deals and financial information
   - Customer data
   - Vehicle information
   - Payments and payoffs

2. **HR Data** (from BambooHR)
   - Employee information
   - Commission structures

3. **Financial Data**
   - Transactions
   - Revenue tracking

4. **Marketing and Sales Data**
   - Lead generation
   - Customer acquisition

## Implementation Plan
1. Analyze existing bronze tables to identify entities and relationships
2. Design star schema model with facts and dimensions
3. Create transformation queries to populate the star schema
4. Set up Hex dashboards and reports for business users
5. Document the schema and provide training for finance teams

## Benefits
- Enable ad-hoc reporting without developer involvement
- Connect data from multiple sources in a single reporting environment
- Optimize query performance for analytical workloads
- Provide standardized business metrics and KPIs
- Support historical analysis and trend reporting

## Hex Integration
Hex will connect directly to Databricks to query the gold-level star schema, providing:
- Interactive dashboards
- Self-service report building
- Data exploration capabilities
- Scheduled report delivery

## Data Entities

This is just a preliminary list of data entities that exist in the organization.  Fill in what we are missing, we will need to model each relevant entity into Facts and Dimensions.

- Lease End Application Data
    - Deal
        - VSC
        - GAP
        - Original Lease
        - Loan - Check if we are keeping track of all applications or just the selected one
            - Bank
        - Driver - Mask PII, no social, no DOB, no personal address
            - Credit Application -
    - Vehicle
        - Make
        - Model
        - OEM
        - etc
    - Title - Low Prio - dates
    - Registration
- HR Data
    - Employee
        - Advisors (setter) - Commissioned on credit app, get deal to credit app, pull credit applicant (cost not tied).
        - Financial Specialists (Closer) - send apps to multiple banks then take best deal, upsell GAP and VSC, Title & Registration
        - Structuring Manager - work with banks to get them a deal if they have lower credit
        - Title Clerk -
    - Commissions - Does everyone have the same commission rate, or is that configured per employee
- NetSuite Data -
    - Transaction
    - 
    - Account
    - Transactions
    - Vendors
- Marketing
    - Google Ads
    - Facebook Ads
    - Tater Taught
    - Send Grid
    - Rudderstack
    - Phone Campaign
- Sales
    - Hubspot
    - Kixie - Don't really care about this.
    - Knox -
    - NOTE:  DD - deal creation date is funding date.  Collect down payment from buyer, Signatures done, bank funded, then lien
    - Netsuite recognizes deal date as the payoff date, the date the payoff to the lien holder happens, Jeremy wants to unify on the the deal date
- Title & Registration
    - No really good data, that process is handled in google sheets.
    - But on completion there should be a finalized timestamp.
