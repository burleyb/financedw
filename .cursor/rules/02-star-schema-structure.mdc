# Star Schema Data Warehouse Structure

The data warehouse follows a star schema design with fact tables connected to multiple dimension tables.

## Fact Tables

Fact tables contain the business metrics, KPIs, and measurements with foreign keys to dimension tables.

- Metrics are typically numeric values that can be aggregated
- Each fact table row represents an event or transaction
- Fact tables contain references (foreign keys) to dimension tables

## Dimension Tables

Dimension tables provide the context for the metrics in fact tables.

- Contain descriptive attributes about business entities
- Have a primary key that fact tables reference
- Generally do not change frequently (slowly changing dimensions)

## Common Dimensions

- Time dimension (date, month, quarter, year)
- Customer dimension
- Product dimension
- Location dimension

## Implementation

The star schema is implemented in Databricks, with tables stored as Delta tables for transactional consistency and performance.
